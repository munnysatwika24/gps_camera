# gps_camera

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project serves as the foundation for a Flutter application.
I have utilised several packages for this project, including geolocation, geocoding, camera, and image. The user can access the camera panel and click an image based on his location after successfully logging in.
He can view the area in advanceÂ 
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
